      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Organizing and scheduling my life has always been a priority. I have multiple notebooks, planners, online and whiteboard calenders along with plenty of To-Do lists. My tasks are catagorized by level of urgency and cover everything from school to shopping lists. The purpose of my plan is to create a site where I can can keep track of everything in one place. Focus my life instead of having a scattered collection.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Initally, I made this site for personal reasons, but then I realized this could benefit other people as well. It would be available for all ages and accessible from all devices. From students, parents, employees, anyone who needs a place to organize what they need to get done. It would be to make their life simpler.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        Blueprint Life offers a place to schedule, plan, and organize your time. This will be the home page and give a general overview of everything you need to work on. On it, there will be a calendar that shows what to expect for the specific month. You can mark specific dates and times to pay attention to. There’s a tab on the side for general things you need to complete that day or month. It’s great to use to keep track of appointments and deadlines. Every month also has a theme and quote that is provided or can be changed for individual tastes. In addition, there’s a section for monthly goals and habits for the user to work on overall. Finally, there's a good and a bad section, where people can record what happened on certain days and their feelings on the matter. A journal section if you will. It’s an opportunity for reflection and growth. Reflection is deliberate and structured thinking about choices. It is an integral step to improving ourselves and utilizing our time. Through reflection, one can look clearly at successes and struggles and consider options for change. There’s not much instructional content or help that needs to be given as it will be different for every single person.

      </ul>
      <h3>Weekly Agenda</h3>
      <p>
        The second page starts to narrow down the month into something more manageable. It has events that are more frequent and upcoming. Different activities can be color coded to the user’s desires. You can set a repeating event to avoid having to add it each week as well. This is where it becomes truly customizable for all ages. For students, they can put down class times and dates when assignments/projects are due. Employees can do the same for work schedules and social events. People can see the future of a week at a glance. This page is to examine one’s itinerary at every hour and determine how to best optimize the time you are given. On the bottom, there is a section to keep track of important things to remember for the week or other things. It truly depends upon the person using it. Plan or blueprint life in general, for that, is how one becomes successful. Those who fail to plan, plan to fail.

      </ul>
      <h3>To-Do</h3>
      <p>
        The final page stops dealing with the overall and truly focuses on the specifics. It deals with lists, ranging from the top 3 most important things to do that day, errands, shopping items, and daily agendas. The page will be customized based again on the person who fills it out. There is also a section for habits or specific goals one has in mind. They can record how often they complete their task and see their progression. "When performance is measured, performance improves. When performance is measured and reported, the rate of improvement accelerates." It’s a place to observe behaviors/habits and work on improving or adapting them. There is also another free section to change as desired, for tasks or items that don’t fit into the lists above. An example of someone’s daily agenda could be to finish an assignment for their Bio class, get milk and eggs, organize their closet, practice the piano for 30 minutes, etc. This page would help them organize everything in a presentable on coherent manner.
